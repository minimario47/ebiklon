# Archive for R5A

This archive contains the files and a summary of the steps used to create the interactive `R5A` railway diagram.

## Files

- `index.html`: The final, self-contained HTML file with the embedded SVG and JavaScript.
- `R5A.svg`: The original, clean SVG data for the R5A diagram, extracted from the source HTML.

## Steps Taken

1.  **Initial Analysis**: Began with a file incorrectly named `gbg.json`, which was identified as SVG data and renamed to `gbg.svg`.
2.  **CORS Error**: Attempting to load the SVG via `fetch()` in JavaScript resulted in a CORS error because the files were being accessed from the local filesystem (`file://`).
3.  **Local Server**: A local web server was started using `python3 -m http.server` to serve the files over `http://`, resolving the CORS issue.
4.  **SVG Parsing Error**: The browser failed to parse the `gbg.svg` file, reporting an "Extra content at the end of the document" error. This was due to the SVG file being a collection of SVG fragments rather than a single, well-formed SVG document.
5.  **Extraction and Embedding**: To fix the parsing error, the original, complete `<svg id="R5A">` element was extracted from the `Titti2 - Göteborg, Skandiahamnen, Sävenäs.htm` file.
6.  **Final `index.html`**: A final `index.html` was constructed by embedding the clean SVG directly into the HTML file. JavaScript was also included in the file to:
    -   Reset the track colors to a neutral grey.
    -   Remove the train numbers from the diagram.
    -   Add click event listeners to all signals and tracks to make them interactive.
